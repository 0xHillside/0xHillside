# Hey :3
## Bio about myself!

Ill be documenting my journey studying random stuff and making observations on things i deem, cool, interesting or batshit insane.
I like to play boot2root & attack n' defense hacking, main focus now is CTF challenges.

Goals from whats being currently worked on to more distant future
- Current goals
	- Getting eJPT certification
	- learning python
	- Mastering web CTF challenges, abit embarassing considering i love boot2root lol

- End goals?
	- Winning a CTF IRL.
  	- Getting a OSCP cert.
	- Creating _my own custom_ C2 framework
